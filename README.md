Okay so I made this thing and it's a fake operating system using Python. I spent like 3 hours or so on this but it's not quite done yet.

Uses lots of content; only Files - Copy is redundant (as you can probably guess).

So far I need to:
-Rework the Files system (it currently deletes all content on the FakeOS, including FakeOS32)
-Add the Email client.
-Write up the in-app usage guidlines and agreements, as stated by FakeSoft Corprations.
-Actually give the quit button a function.
-Extend the corruption system to more strings/add symbol distortion features for added oomph.
-Get a life.
